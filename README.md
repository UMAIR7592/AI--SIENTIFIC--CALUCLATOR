## 👨‍💻 Developed by Muhammad Umair

This is a smart **AI-based Scientific Calculator** built in **C++**, which can evaluate complex expressions using the **BODMAS rule**. It supports advanced mathematical functions, expression parsing, and constant recognition like π and _e_.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Follows BODMAS** operator precedence.
- ➕ Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- 🔢 Handles decimal & complex expressions.
- 🧠 **Scientific Functions**:
  - `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`
  - `sqrt()`, `log()`, `ln()`
  - `fact()` (factorial)
- 📌 **Constants**:
  - `pi` ≈ 3.14159
  - `e` ≈ 2.71828
- 🎨 Terminal **Color Output** for enhanced readability.
